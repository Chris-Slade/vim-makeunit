INTRODUCTION                                    *makeunit-intro* *:MakeUnit*

This plugin provides a command, *:MakeUnit*, which scans the current file
(expected to be a Java source file) and creates a unit-test file. If the file
has a package declaration, that package will be used in the unit-test file.
Likewise, for each public method "foo" in the source file, a corresponding  

    @Test
    public void testFoo() {
    }

stub method will be created.

SETTINGS                                        *makeunit-settings*
                                                *makeunit-config*

                                                *g:makeunit_imports*
g:makeunit_imports
    A list of imports to be placed in the generated file. The default is
[ 'org.junit.Test' ], which results in  

    import org.junit.Test;

being placed before any static imports or the class declaration but after the
package statement, if present.

                                                *g:makeunit_static_imports*
g:makeunit_static_imports
    A list of static imports to be placed in the generated file. Static imports
are placed after any non-static imports, but before the class declaration. The
default is [ 'org.junit.assertTrue' ], which produces  

    import static org.junit.assertTrue;

                                                *g:makeunit_use_allman_style*
g:makeunit_use_allman_style
    When set to a true value, opening braces ("{") will be placed on the line
following the statement which requires them, e.g.  

    public class MyTest
    {
        ...
    }

When set to a false value, K&R/Linux-style braces will be used, e.g.  

    public class MyTest {
        ...
    }

False by default.
